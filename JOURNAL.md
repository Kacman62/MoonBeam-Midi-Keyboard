## 10/25/2025 - First Prototype  

![IMG_2552](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--edd1b93a70740099223deb56882091ca5195b20a/IMG_2552.jpg)

I spent most of this time in research. I liked the guide put out by hack club, but wanted a fully digital synthesizer, not just the controller. After looking at different chips and MCUs, I found that the mozzi library with a pi pico and an analog multiplexer and DAC would probably get me the best results. Before going into major PCB design, I wanted to make a breadboard cut down version just to prove it. I did get audio out of the speaker, and the next step is to get inputs and outputs from the pico.  

## 10/26/2025 1 PM - Finished Breadboard Prototype

I spent most of this time upgrading the prototype. I added more buttons to 12, added another slide potentiometer, an I2C screen. 

I also started making code (with a lot of help from AI) it shows promise but I am having trouble getting the notes to sustain, so I might need to write the code myself.

Before that though, im going to design the PCB next and finalize the features. Going good so far though.  

## 10/26/2025 6 PM - Completed Schematic

Spent a lot of this time researching how to get audio out. I took a headphone jack out of a broken usb adapter and wired it up in the schematic. I decided to use the pcm5100, and two TI chips, the lm4810 amd the 4861 to amplify the speaker and the headphones. Also did some other cleaning up, made a new footprint for the slide pots, added debug LEDS.

Next Im going to set out the PCB
  

## 10/27/2025 - Laid out and Routed PCB

I laid out the PCB today. It was pretty challenging to get it all to fit together logically and in a small footprint. It ended up being about 350mm x 90mm. I'm pretty happy with how it looks and next I will work on making a cool silkscreen.

I also routed the PCB today, getting the multiplexed buttons was a little challenging, but I got it all done with a pretty small amount of vias.
