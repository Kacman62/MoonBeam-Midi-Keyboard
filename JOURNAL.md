## 10/25/2025 - First Prototype  

![IMG_2552](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--edd1b93a70740099223deb56882091ca5195b20a/IMG_2552.jpg)

I spent most of this time in research. I liked the guide put out by hack club, but wanted a fully digital synthesizer, not just the controller. After looking at different chips and MCUs, I found that the mozzi library with a pi pico and an analog multiplexer and DAC would probably get me the best results. Before going into major PCB design, I wanted to make a breadboard cut down version just to prove it. I did get audio out of the speaker, and the next step is to get inputs and outputs from the pico.
