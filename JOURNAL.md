## 10/25/2025 - First Prototype  

![IMG_2552](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--edd1b93a70740099223deb56882091ca5195b20a/IMG_2552.jpg)

I spent most of this time in research. I liked the guide put out by hack club, but wanted a fully digital synthesizer, not just the controller. After looking at different chips and MCUs, I found that the mozzi library with a pi pico and an analog multiplexer and DAC would probably get me the best results. Before going into major PCB design, I wanted to make a breadboard cut down version just to prove it. I did get audio out of the speaker, and the next step is to get inputs and outputs from the pico.  

## 10/26/2025 1 PM - Finished Breadboard Prototype

I spent most of this time upgrading the prototype. I added more buttons to 12, added another slide potentiometer, an I2C screen. 

I also started making code (with a lot of help from AI) it shows promise but I am having trouble getting the notes to sustain, so I might need to write the code myself.

Before that though, im going to design the PCB next and finalize the features. Going good so far though.  

## 10/26/2025 6 PM - Completed Schematic

Spent a lot of this time researching how to get audio out. I took a headphone jack out of a broken usb adapter and wired it up in the schematic. I decided to use the pcm5100, and two TI chips, the lm4810 amd the 4861 to amplify the speaker and the headphones. Also did some other cleaning up, made a new footprint for the slide pots, added debug LEDS.

Next Im going to set out the PCB
  

## 10/27/2025 6 PM - Laid out and Routed PCB

I laid out the PCB today. It was pretty challenging to get it all to fit together logically and in a small footprint. It ended up being about 350mm x 90mm. I'm pretty happy with how it looks and next I will work on making a cool silkscreen.

I also routed the PCB today, getting the multiplexed buttons was a little challenging, but I got it all done with a pretty small amount of vias. 
  

## 10/27/2025 9 PM - Added Silkscreen

Went through all the components and added silkscreen of their values to make assembly easy. also added my and hack clubs logos. and found a moon pattern and added that to the back of the PCB. Also went to Logo.com and got a logo for the project made.

  

## 10/28/2025 - Cleaned Up Board and Started Code

Mainly just cleaned up a bunch of loose ends this session. I cleaned up some routing things, replaced an LED with a GPIO test pad, adjusted the back silkscreen. I made a test print to see if the switch placement was good and it felt a little far away from front to back so I moved the back row closer to the front.

I also started (vibe) coding using the Mozzi audio library. the audio portion looks good, but it is untested, next im going to try and add multi core and put the OLED and the digital input logic there.

Mainly just need to finish code and make a case before it is ready to be shipped.
